# Scalable 2-Tier Architecture on AWS

## üöÄ Project Overview
his project showcases the design and implementation of a **highly scalable and reliable 2-tier architecture on AWS.** It uses an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic, **EC2 instances** for compute, **Auto Scaling** for elasticity, **RDS** for a managed database solution, **S3 + CloudFront** for static content delivery, and CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.

## üèó Architecture Overview (2-Tier)

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Load Balancer (Public Subnet)**
Handles traffic distribution and improves fault tolerance.

                    ‚¨áÔ∏è

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer (EC2 + Auto Scaling)**
Contains the application servers running on EC2 instances. Instances are automatically scaled based on traffic demand.

                    ‚¨áÔ∏è

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Layer (Amazon RDS)**
Amazon Relational Database Service stores and manages data securely.

## üåü Key Features of the Project
- **üîÑ Load Balancing**: Used an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to ensure high availability and distribute traffic evenly.
- **üìà Scalability**: Configured **Auto Scaling** to dynamically scale EC2 instances based on traffic patterns.
- **üìä Monitoring**: Set up **CloudWatch** for logging, monitoring, and alerting on performance metrics.
- **üîí Secure Communication**: Configured **HTTPS** using an SSL certificate via **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** for secure traffic.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **AWS Services**: EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, RDS (MySQL), CloudWatch, ACM, S3, CloudFront.
- **Database**: MySQL (Amazon RDS).
- **Backend**: Node.js.
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Hosted on S3 + CloudFront for CDN).

## üìú Project Workflow
- **Frontend Tier**: The client-facing web application hosted on **S3** and served via **CloudFront**.
- **Backend Tier**: Application logic runs on **EC2 instances** connected to the **RDS database**.
- **Database Tier**: Amazon **RDS** provides a scalable, managed database solution.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: **CloudWatch** monitors performance and sends alerts for resource utilization or errors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ S3 & CloudFront for Static Content**
- Created an **S3 bucket** and enabled **static website hosting**.
- Uploaded frontend files (**HTML, CSS, JavaScript**).
- Configured **CloudFront** to serve content with caching and performance optimization.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ EC2 Instances for Web and App Tiers**
- Launched **EC2 instances** and configured **security groups** for **SSH** and **ALB traffic**.
- Installed **Node.js backend** and frontend application components.
- Created an **AMI** for Auto Scaling.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- Created an **ALB** and registered **EC2 instances** as **target group members**.
- Configured **HTTPS using ACM** for secure communication.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Scaling for High Availability**
- Configured **Auto Scaling groups** for **EC2 instances**.
- Set **scaling policies** based on **CPU utilization and traffic demand**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ RDS Setup for Database Tier**
- Provisioned an **RDS instance with MySQL**.
- Configured **subnet groups** and set up **Multi-AZ** for fault tolerance.
- Connected the **application layer** to the database securely.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring and Alerts with CloudWatch**
- Enabled **CloudWatch metrics** for **EC2, ALB, and RDS**.
- Created **dashboards** to visualize metrics like **CPU utilization, database connections, and response time**.
- Set up **CloudWatch alarms** for **resource utilization spikes** or **health check failures**.

## üöß Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Handling sudden spikes in traffic | Configured **Auto Scaling** to respond dynamically to **CPU utilization**. |
| Secure communication between the client and application | Used **AWS ACM** for **SSL certificate management** and enforced **HTTPS** on the ALB. |
| Database high availability and backups | Configured **RDS with Multi-AZ** and enabled **automated backups**. |

## üéØ Learnings and Impact
- Learned to **design and deploy** a **fault-tolerant, scalable, and secure architecture** on AWS.
- Gained hands-on experience with key AWS services like **ALB, Auto Scaling, and CloudWatch**.
- Built a **production-grade solution** suitable for **real-world applications**.
